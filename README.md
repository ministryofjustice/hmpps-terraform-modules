## GitHub Actions

An action to delete the branch after merge has been added.
Also an action that will tag when branch is merged to master
See https://github.com/anothrNick/github-tag-action

```
Bumping

Manual Bumping: Any commit message that includes #major, #minor, or #patch will trigger the respective version bump. If two or more are present, the highest-ranking one will take precedence.

Automatic Bumping: If no #major, #minor or #patch tag is contained in the commit messages, it will bump whichever DEFAULT_BUMP is set to (which is minor by default).

Note: This action will not bump the tag if the HEAD commit has already been tagged.
